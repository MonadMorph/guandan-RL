# guandan-RL
A reinforcement learning system that plays a certain type of collaborative card game, Guandan.

The project is mainly for me you learn the basics of RL and getting my hands dirty. Still feel free to use it if you find that project interesting.

Currently my idea is to use policy gradient with Transformer as backbone, or ResNet backbone + MCTS. I may use rlcard as the training framework, but that might be too easy.
